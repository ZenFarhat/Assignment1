<h2>Brief profile:</h2>
<p>I am a Bachelor of Biomedicine graduate who recently re-evaluated their career path and found IT the place to be. I am a Kuwait-born, Lebanese individual.  During my spare time when I am not doing university work, I am usually playing the guitar (been playing for 8 years or so), playing computer games, or messing around with code in python or java. ðŸ˜Š </p>


<h1>My interest in IT:</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>My interest in IT stemmed from a very young age, when weâ€™d first gotten our family computer, I saw it more than just a machine that is used to play games. This machine could save, print text, connect to the internet, run programs and do so much more. Admittedly I had probably â€˜brokenâ€™ the family computer many times through my own exploring of programs, code, downloading things etc. But it was all the silly errors and dilemmas I would get myself into which had helped me become quite tech savvy and be very intuitive with computers in general. The prestige of become a Dr through my first degree (Bach of biomedicine, 6.4 GPA) was just not worth it â€“ so Iâ€™d returned to my original roots and passion. Inspirations for me included Michael reeves, a tech youtuber who builds robots and automates them through programming. 
I chose RMIT because of its location, facilities and diversity of industry-experienced staff members. I hope to become a proficient programmer in various language and develop a strong intuition for programming in general. My interests would be in web dev, app dev and AI dev.</p>



<h1>Ideal Job (for the time being):</h1>
<h2>https://www.seek.com.au/job/50357297?type=standard#searchRequestToken=c124bc92-d743-4ddf-b589-39f47f259d52</h2>


<p>This is a position for a junior software developer looking for an early foot in the door in the world of IT. This position is not in Melbourne (where I currently live), but still appeals to me in many aspects.
This is an ideal job for me in the meantime â€“ looking at the required skillset, it seems as though these are very attainable foundation skills which are covered in the RMIT Bachelor of IT course. My plan to attain these skills and further develop them is through the bachelor of IT program and hopefully do un-paid volunteer work to put the theory into practice. I currently have many skills which I have attained through my Biomedicine degree, in particular, the use of excel, graph processing software, word & usage of PowerPoint.
Whilst not directly correlated to IT, my biomedicine program also taught me to be extremely careful with following protocol and understanding what is expected of me during a practical/work placement. This furthermore allowed me to develop a strong skillset in breaking down, analysing & executing a task that is expected of me.</p>

<h1>Personal Profile â€“ Myers-Briggs test, learning style test(s):</h1>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Myers-Briggs test (https://www.truity.com/):</h2>
<h2>According to an online Myers-Briggs test, these are my results for my personality type:</h2>

<p>INFJ â€“ The counsellor
INFJs are creative nurtures with a strong sense of personal integrity with a strong drive to help others realize their potential. Additionally, INFJs are creative, dedicated and have a talent for helping others with original solutions to their own personal challenges.</p>

<h2>Learning style test (http://www.educationplanner.org/):</h2>
<p>Visual: 50%</p>
<p>Auditory: 40%</p>
<p>Tactile: 10%</p>
<p> test portrayed me to be a visual/auditory learner, meaning I prefer learning through seeing things being done in action, portrayed as in image or video or doing tasks myself to figure them out with visual ques on my progress. As an auditory learner, I also listen well to instructions, furthermore, allowing me to execute tasks in an up-to-standard manner through processing instructions clearly. [3]</p>

<h2>5 personality test ((https://www.truity.com/):</h2>

<p>AN stands for:</p>
<p>Openness</p>
<p>Tendency for a person to think in abstract and in complex ways</p>
<p>Conscientiousness:</p>
<p>A personâ€™s ability to exercise self-discipline and control to pursue goals</p>
<p>Extraversion:</p>
<p>Inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, usually in the form of attention from others.</p>
<p>Agreeableness:</p>
<p>Personâ€™s tendency to put others needs ahead of their own and would rather cooperate than compete with others</p>
<p>Neuroticism:</p>
<p>Personâ€™s tendency to experience negative emotions when in a tough situation. [1]</p>

<h2>Overall statement</h2>
<p>Overall, these results portray an accurate depiction of who I am and my work ethic. I have a creative and analytical side when it comes to working. I am a visual and auditory learner; I believe that this is a good combination of learning types as they are highly intertwined in some regards. Additionally, meeting my goals is highly important to me. These traits are important to me when working in a team, as I always have it in the back of my mind that I am working for a greater, larger cause. When forming a team for a project or work, it is important to have a mix of personality types to compliment one another instead of counteracting one another.</p>

<h1>My IT project idea:</h1>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>An idea that I have in mind is an online platform where you can use high-specification computers via remote access. This can be used as an educational, work, or personal platform catering to those who cannot afford a high-end machine but would still like occasional access to one when they have very specific tasks or needs that need to be completed. These computers would be hosted at a location and can be accessed via website/a remote desktop client. A general target audience for this would be universities, workplaces, libraries, schools, or people who do not have access to a desktop but do have access to a laptop.</p> 

<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>Statistics show that 67% of Australia owns a desktop computer (varying in specifications), whilst 53% own a netbook/laptop [2]. There is a huge market for people who either do not own a computer, people who own a laptop but not a computer, or people who do not own either. By providing a cheap, online, subscription-based service to access a reliable machine, this platform would be able to cater to the gap in the market of people who do not own a high-end computer. This would differ to a virtual machine â€“ as these would be physical computers located at a venue which are running 24/7.</p>

<h2>Product description:</h2>
<p>In bare essence, the product involves 3 major components. The user, the software/website to access the machines and the high-end machine.
The user would be required to sign up to a website which essentially allows them to remotely access a machine, this can be session based or subscription based. The sign-up process tailors to the users needs in order to find the right computer for them to access, ie they would be surveyed as they sign up to find out what sort of tasks they would want to accomplish using the platform.</p>
<p>Users will be allowed to store work, documents, etc on their account and would be able to drag-drop them into a computer that they are using. A baseline account would have a small amount of storage and limited features/services, and a limited time frame to access computers. Subscriptions would allow larger storage, access to files from any device anywhere at anytime and 24/7 chat support. The website would feature a simple booking system allowing users to book a computer on a certain day & time, showing all available time slots to remotely access a computer. Subscribed users would have more time slots available with priority booking and queues.</p>
<p>The remote-control software would allow users to ping for help, access files in storage, drag and drop files into the remote-controlled desktop, and have an option to back up all files into their account and immediately wipe the physical drive in which the work was stored. This system would ensure that the client feels safe using the platform. Each client is given a unique code/password to enter to have access to the computer that they have booked. These features would also be available on the web version of the client, which further allows use for people who do not own their own computer but are using one from work, a library or university etc.</p> 
<p>The computers themselves would have to be hosted in a highly secure and cold environment to optimise performance, ideally somewhere with an extremely strong and reliable internet access. These computers would have the entire adobe and office suite. Other programs can be added over time by popular demand etc. Limitations would have to be enforced on the computers, ie not letting users tamper with settings, task manager etc. Within the venue, the computers would be arranged in rows of tiers. One row being the lowest specification computers and slowly progressing to the high-end ones, dependant on user needs. A system restore point would have to be constantly created to back-up any user files in the case of an incident (power outage, etc). The plan for this project would be to eventually expand to more locations so users are able to pick the closest host possible to them for remote access. <p/>

<h2>Tools and technologies:</h2>
<p>Software that would be required would be the client-side client and the admin-side client. The admin-side client is for troubleshooting anything which clients/customers would have. As far as hardware goes, a server to back up files for a limit time (100 days or so), high-end computers (a dozen or so at the start) and the venue of course. The venue would be highly secured and constantly monitored. Staff would be available during work hours to troubleshoot any hardware problems.</p>

<h2>Skills required:</h2>
<p>A strong programming team to work on the server, client-side, and admin-side software to ensure that there are no bugs or flaws in the software. User data is a highly sensitive area to be working with, ensuring that all of it is safe would be a top priority in the platform.  Additionally, staff that are highly familiar with hardware, hardware specifications and troubleshooting servers would be required. These are skills which are commonly taught within computer science, computer systems and information technology degrees.</p>

<h2>Outcome:</h2>
<p>The outcome of this project would be a platform for people who do not readily have access to a high-end computer and find themselves not necessarily needing one at their home. This project would span across schools, universities, workplaces, hospitals and libraries. This would solve the issue of slow, unreliable computers by giving users the option of immediate cloud storage and reliable computer access at any given time based on the service they opt-in for. Eventually this would expand into a platform that is richer in features and possibilities. IE running games, use of super computers online or even access a computer from your phone/tablet with an intuitive and easy app interface.</p>
